- colors for type and statuses

- Redo ticket modal - with url link?

- add ALL form validations

- manage projects

                    think about how to allow external users:

      DONE - Project has an admin, that created it (P0) 
      
      DONE - Project holds one or more members

      DONE - Each member sees only the projects he's a member of (Remove private / public projects) (P0)

      FE:
      
      - When creating project, show add members

      - Add members to projects

      - Add hovering username display
